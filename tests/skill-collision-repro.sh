# Repro and regression check for the command/skill name-collision fix (CHANGES 0.9.7).
#
# The Skill tool resolves a name shared by commands/<name>.md and
# skills/<name>/SKILL.md to the command; disable-model-invocation: true on the
# command flips resolution to the skill. That precedence is UNDOCUMENTED
# upstream, so re-run this after Claude Code upgrades. Last verified on 2.1.195.
#
# Beyond the collision repro, this enforces the static maintenance invariants from
# CHANGES.md: the command/skill/leaf flags, version parity across the three manifests,
# and the default model quad's identity across provider dispatch, the panel skills,
# and setup-pstack. The
# static checks need no CLI; only the behavioral legs below do.
#
# Manual test: the behavioral legs need the claude CLI and API access; four Fable calls.
